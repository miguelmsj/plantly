# Add second plant by navigating to newPlant screen
# Note: Since we now have plants, there's no "Add your first plant" button
# We need to find another way to add plants - checking the navigation
- back
# Let's add another plant using the add button (if available in navigation)
# This might need adjustment based on your actual UI navigation
